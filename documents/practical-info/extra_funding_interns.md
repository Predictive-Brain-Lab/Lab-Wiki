# Receiving Additional Funding During Your Stay

Under certain circumstances, lab members or interns may receive (additional) funding during their time at the Predictive Brain Lab. You might qualify for one of these programs if you meet their requirements.

* Erasmus Internship Program

  If you are a student or a recent graduate coming from outside the Netherlands, you can apply for funding through the Erasmus program. This is similar to the regular Erasmus program, but instead of finding a university, you look for an institution, such as the Predictive Brain Lab (PBL). One downside is that you need to begin the application process before your arrival to the Netherlands, typically around the same time as other students apply for regular Erasmus opportunities at your university. The application rules vary between universities, so be sure to check your universityâ€™s Erasmus section for specific details.
