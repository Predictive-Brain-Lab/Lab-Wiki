# Lab Basics
{: .no_toc }

If you are new to the lab, or have more general admin questions, this is the place to start. You can find a guide to the lab, guides for more general procedures and some useful links to Donders Institute resources.

For a general introduction to our research group, you might want to look at our [lab handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RMTpcPl8lwJ6Ozf3QIlTaehedsL_tSUC/view?usp=sharing).
